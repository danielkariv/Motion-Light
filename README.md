# Motion-Light </br>
A multiplayer online P2P web game inspired by the Tron game. Made with Phaser.io, webRTC, and ASP.NET. </br>
</br>
⚠️ Warning: This project wasn't update for years, and I have been alerted by Github's own security bot that there are multiple security vulnerabilities on this project! Run it on your own risk.

It was my finals project in 'Computer Science' course at High School at 2017. I have only updated the SQL database, it's connection, and the ICE servers. </br>
Feel free to use it as a base, or a guide for webRTC applaction.

-'simple-peer'- webRTC library which Feross Aboukhadijeh made. It makes peers connection much easier (https://github.com/feross/simple-peer)</br>
</br>
Q: What do i do to run this?</br>
A: Well last time i checked, Visual Studio 2018 could run it without problems. </br>
   If there are problems, it may be the ICE servers that the project uses. I am have set it up with Google STUN servers, but if they shut down the servers, you could just replace the cfg-iceserver in the javascript to a different server. </br>
  </br>
Q: How do you play this game?</br>
A: Arrow keys for movement, and you need to avoid light walls, other players, and the borders. It is simaler to Sanke if you dont know what is Tron.</br>
