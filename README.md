# Motion-Light </br>
A multiplayer online P2P web game inspired by the Tron game. Made with Phaser.io, webRTC, and ASP.NET. </br>
</br>
There is no plan to keep devlop it, It was my finals work in 'SC' at High School. from 2017, I only update the SQL database, it's connection, and the ICE servers. </br>
Feel free to use it as a base, or a guide for webRTC applaction.

-'simple-peer'- webRTC library which Feross Aboukhadijeh made. It makes peers connection much easier (https://github.com/feross/simple-peer)

Q: What do i do to run this?</br>
A: Well last time i checked, Visual Studio 2018 could run it without problems. </br>
   If there are problems, it may be the ICE servers that i use. I am using Google STUN servers, but if they shut down, you should just replace the cfg-iceserver in the javascript to diffrent servers. </br>
  </br>
Q: How do you play this game?</br>
A: Arrow keys for movement, and you need to avoid light walls, other players, and the borders. It is simaler to Sanke if you dont know what is Tron.</br>
